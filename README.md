<p>This branch of Distant Realms Python is SnowBlitz remastered really. I'll be implementing the whole game in this modular framework and build a better entity system for it as well. I'm halfway there. The next parts will be finishing the entity system and then i'll work on the rendering logic. It should actually be stupidly easy and i can copy over a bunch of code.</p>
