**SNOW BLITZ PRODUCTION REPOSITORY**

<h2>Welcome To Snow Blitz. Stay open, friends!</h2>

<p>Any issues, you can email me at dev@snowblitz.net</p>

<p>This README markdown file will be used to document the framework, the game, and all the APIs allowing everything to connect.</p>

**THE "PRODUCTION" REPOSITORY** 

<p>This branch, the main branch will be for cutting edge features. Features need to be at least feature complete upon commit unless i'm personally feeling lazy.</p>

<p>The most recent stable update released (source code), will be available on its own branch. We will delete that branch upon a new version.</p>

<p>Previous versions will be archived on snowblitz.net/downloads/archive/source, and will be organized by version, latest first. I hate going into some software archive and finding it difficult to locate downloads. Every single list item MUST BE a download link for that version. The same applies to snowblitz.net/downloads/archive/builds/[linux|windows|macos], and players will have an easy time regardless of their skill level. This is the MOST IMPORTANT part of the project.</p>
