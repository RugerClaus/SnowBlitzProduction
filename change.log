# CHANGELOG

LEGEND:
Development version <VERSION x.x.x> - <DATE> yyyy-mm-dd - Specifies latest version, not current changes in this codebase. use UNRELEASED for the date if that is the case

Development version Beta 0.9.1 - 2026-02-01 
--------------------------------------------
- Deployed application for first round of playtesting
- No currently known issues with this build
- Optimized Build Script to remove internal assets after build completion

Development version Beta 0.9.2 - 2026-02-03 
-------------------------------------------
- Overhauled LeaderboardViewer to use a state machine for fetching data for better management of state
- Prettied up UI in leaderboard
- Removed the last vestiges of pygame from outside core/guts
- Began implementing the Keys class in core/guts/input to map keys for the framework and input manager.
    - This will make future updates to the controls system much smoother, and will allow for custom input behavior (i.e. capital letters, custom characters, and more)
- Revamped build system separately for windows and linux, you still need a bash shell for windows though
- Added a file for tracking feature requests as well as a file for tracking active bugs
- Added a NEW SYSTEM for updating the application at the click of a button 
- Added updater executable that gets created at build time so that the game can update

Development version Beta 0.9.3 - 2026-02-04
--------------------------------------------

- Fixed a bug where linux builds would not start if they were running a version of python previous to 3.12
    - Mainly due to an issue where newer versions of python allow f strings to use """" rather than "''", which while handy as a feature
    - Causes ungodly compatibility issues
- Fixed a bug where the PLAYER_POWER_STATE was being set to PowerUpType.TYPE, which is a totally impossible transition.
    - logging for invalid state transitions is paying dividends now

- Made button hover UI more uniform setting a standard color for text when mouse is hovering over a button
    - active buttons will have text that turns PURPLE when hovering and will change the program state to whatever that button does
    - inactive buttons will have text that turns GREY when hovering and will not change anything in the program state

- Added button to link to the website from the game
- Made update button pop out and more obvious with contrasting background color and added text near the title indicating update availability
- Set alpha value on button surfaces (this should have been done months ago)
- Set max volume to 5 and changed default volume to 3
- Made tutorial prompts check the actual key bindings to tell the player how to play

Development version Beta 0.9.4 - UNRELEASED
-------------------------------------------
- Added to the splash screen system and introduced game mechanics in the loading screen
- Fixed a bug where entities would artifact at the top left hand corner of the screen
    - This bug was around for quite some time. Zap you go
- Made player's username flash if they are on the leaderboard
- Renamed APPMODE to DEBUG_STATE and rehandled it as a debug overlay state manager
    - Basically, the debug overlay shows active states (next part of this upgrade) and can be toggled
    - Eventually I will be adding OS info, as well as hardware info. Preparing this for larger games.
- Put all environment specific logic into an `example.config.py` and made `setup.py` to load the real config file for the dev
- Added a score multiplier
- Added new entity type: Multiplier Upgrade
- Added masking for player collisions
- Added Multiplier Upgrade section to Tutorial Mode
- Implemented a half baked daylight cycle that is not ready for the game.
