LEGEND:
Development version <VERSION x.x.x> - <DATE> yyyy-mm-dd - Specifies latest version, not current changes in this codebase. use UNRELEASED for the date if that is the case

Development version Beta 0.9.1 - 2026-02-01 
--------------------------------------------
- Deployed application for first round of playtesting
- No currently known issues with this build
- Optimized Build Script to remove internal assets after build completion

Development version Beta 0.9.2 - 2026-02-03 
-------------------------------------------
- Overhauled LeaderboardViewer to use a state machine for fetching data for better management of state
- Prettied up UI in leaderboard
- Removed the last vestiges of pygame from outside core/guts

    - This will make future updates to the controls system much smoother, and will allow for custom input behavior (i.e. capital letters, custom characters, and more)
- Revamped build system separately for windows and linux, you still need a bash shell for windows though
- Added a file for tracking feature requests as well as a file for tracking active bugs
- Added a NEW SYSTEM for updating the application at the click of a button 
- Added updater executable that gets created at build time so that the game can update
