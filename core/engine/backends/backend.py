# This class is for managing backends. This is mostly for visual purposes as DRAW, the Distant Realms Ascended Window is a custom wrapper for OpenGL
# and it basically mimics pygame's API. Or at least it's being designed to do so
# This is to keep the framework contract strict while taking advantage of hardware acceleration
